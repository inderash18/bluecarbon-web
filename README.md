üå± Blue Carbon Token Registry

A Blockchain-powered registry for Blue Carbon ecosystem restoration ‚Äî enabling transparent monitoring, reporting, verification, and tokenization of carbon credits from coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrass beds.

‚∏ª

üí° Project Overview

Blue Carbon ecosystems play a crucial role in capturing and storing CO‚ÇÇ. However, tracking restoration efforts and generating carbon credits is often opaque and centralized.

This project leverages Ethereum-compatible blockchain to:
	‚Ä¢	Immutably store verified restoration data.
	‚Ä¢	Tokenize carbon credits via smart contracts.
	‚Ä¢	Enable NGOs, local communities, and stakeholders to participate.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate field data collected from apps and drones.

‚∏ª

üèó Features
	‚Ä¢	CarbonCreditToken (ERC20)
	‚Ä¢	Mintable by the owner (representing verified carbon credits)
	‚Ä¢	Transparent transactions on the blockchain
	‚Ä¢	Hardhat-powered Backend
	‚Ä¢	Compile and deploy Solidity contracts
	‚Ä¢	Local test environment using Hardhat network
	‚Ä¢	Python / JS Integration
	‚Ä¢	Scripts to interact with deployed contracts
	‚Ä¢	Ready to integrate with a mobile or web frontend

  Installation process for the Backend:

  1.Clone the repository:  
    "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bluecarbon-token.git
  cd bluecarbon-token"

  2. Install dependencies:
     	"npm install"

 3.Run Hardhat:
   	"npx hardhat node"

4. Initialize local accounts:(In another terminal parallel )
   	"npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost"
